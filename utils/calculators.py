"""
app/utils/calculators.py

Pure-Python deterministic calculations (no LLM calls). Carried over from
the original tools/calculators.py — these compute hard numbers
(BMI, savings rate, skill-gap %, etc.) that get fed into the LLM prompt
alongside the user's profile/memory/RAG context, so the model is reasoning
over real numbers instead of guessing them.
